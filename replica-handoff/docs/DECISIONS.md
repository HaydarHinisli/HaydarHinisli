# Product / Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 — Copilot before autonomous caller
Status: accepted

Reason:
- fastest way to validate usefulness
- human remains in control
- generates high-quality preference data
- avoids making the product dependent on TTS quality for first validation

## ADR-002 — Fast Path before Smart Path
Status: accepted

Reason:
- live cold calls cannot wait for long reasoning
- common objections can be handled by a classifier + playbook
- smart reasoning is optional refinement

## ADR-003 — Observable signals, not emotion labels
Status: accepted

Store:
- pause
- WPM
- response latency
- overlap
- pitch change
- word choice

Do not claim:
- anger
- fear
- intelligence
- personality

## ADR-004 — Held meetings/opportunities over booking vanity metrics
Status: accepted

Booking more low-quality meetings is not success. Downstream outcomes receive more weight.

## ADR-005 — Private Learning default
Status: accepted

A customer tenant does not automatically contribute raw calls/transcripts to global training.

## ADR-006 — Manager context, not employee ranking
Status: accepted

REPLICA may show ramp-up, trends and coaching areas. It must not output a termination recommendation or an automated good/bad employee ranking.

## Sprint 0 — Compliance-capable foundations (2026-09-18)

The following ADRs record where the Sprint 0 implementation had to make a concrete
engineering choice that `GLOBAL_PRODUCT_COMPLIANCE_SPEC.md`, `CODER_HANDOFF.md` and
`config/jurisdictions.yaml` describe only at the level of intent, plus the deliberate
scope boundary between "new compliance infrastructure" and "existing hot paths".

## ADR-007 — Sprint 0 enforcement scope: new capabilities are gated, existing hot
paths are not (yet)
Status: accepted

The task explicitly protected the working baseline ("Live-Copilot-Funktionalität und
die aktuell funktionierende Baseline bitte nicht verschlechtern"). `record_audio`,
`transcribe` and `live_assist` are fully implemented in `policy_engine.py` and exposed
via new endpoints (`POST /api/policy/resolve`, `GET /api/calls/{id}/processing-permissions`),
but `POST /api/calls/{id}/turns` and `POST /api/copilot/suggest` still use the existing
`Call.consent_state` gate rather than `can_process()`. Reason: demo/seed calls and any
future tenant without a `jurisdiction_country`/purpose-consent history would otherwise
start failing closed (`requires_legal_review`) on every existing call, which is exactly
what the smoke test after implementation showed for a freshly created call. Wiring
`can_process()` into these two endpoints is deferred to Sprint 1, once real per-call
jurisdiction capture and an auth/tenant context exist to populate it correctly.

`employee_analytics` is the one existing endpoint (`GET /api/manager/overview`) that
Sprint 0 *does* hard-gate with `can_process()`, because it was explicitly named as a
fail-closed function and its own DE tier is satisfiable by seeding one
`ComplianceReviewSignoff` for the pilot tenant — so the baseline keeps working while a
tenant without that signoff is genuinely blocked (see `test_tenant_isolation_review_signoff_does_not_leak`).

Consequence: the new endpoints prove the policy engine and consent ledger work and are
independently tested; production-grade enforcement of the live-call hot path is
explicit Sprint 1/2 work, not silently assumed to already exist.

## ADR-008 — Action-to-jurisdiction-field mapping
Status: accepted

`jurisdictions.yaml` has no dedicated field per `can_process` action, so Sprint 0 maps:
- `record_audio` → `recording` (persistent audio storage; the stricter gate)
- `transcribe`, `live_assist` → `human_copilot` (transient processing that enables
  copilot assistance; transcription without storage is treated as part of "a human
  seller gets AI assistance", not as "recording")
- `employee_analytics` → `employee_analytics`
- `autonomous_call` → `autonomous_marketing_call`
- `network_learning` → `network_intelligence`

Consequence: a jurisdiction that is strict about `recording` but permissive about
`human_copilot` (e.g. Germany: `consent_and_legal_review` vs `enabled_with_conditions`)
can allow live transcription/assist under ordinary consent while still requiring a
recorded compliance review before any persistent audio recording.

## ADR-009 — Two distinct override mechanisms, not one
Status: accepted

`TenantFeatureFlag` (pure kill-switch, tenant × jurisdiction × campaign_type) and
`ComplianceReviewSignoff` (tenant × action × jurisdiction acknowledgement) are modeled
as separate tables with separate semantics:
- A feature flag can only ever move a decision *more* restrictive. It can disable an
  otherwise-allowed action; it can never turn a policy-`denied` action on.
- A review signoff can only resolve a `requires_legal_review` tier; it has no effect on
  a `denied` tier.

This keeps "an admin cannot activate a policy-forbidden feature" true by construction:
`evaluate()` returns `DENIED` for the `denied` tier before it ever looks at flags or
signoffs. Verified by `test_feature_flag_cannot_override_hard_policy_denial`.

## ADR-010 — `autonomous_call` defaults to denied everywhere, independent of jurisdiction
Status: accepted

Several jurisdictions' `autonomous_marketing_call` value (e.g. GB/CA `consent_only`)
would otherwise resolve toward `ALLOWED` once a purpose existed. Multiple docs state the
product default must be OFF in every jurisdiction regardless. Sprint 0 implements this as
`DEFAULT_DENY_ACTIONS = {'autonomous_call'}`: even where the jurisdiction tier is not a
hard `denied`, the action stays `DENIED` until a tenant explicitly enables it via a
`TenantFeatureFlag` — and that flag is still capped by the jurisdiction tier per ADR-009.

## ADR-011 — Policy catalog is cached in-process; no hot reload
Status: accepted (tech debt)

`jurisdiction_policy.get_policy_catalog()` uses `functools.lru_cache`, so a change to
`config/jurisdictions.yaml` requires a process restart to take effect. Acceptable for a
single-process pilot; a DB-backed `jurisdiction_policy` table with an admin UI (as
sketched in `GLOBAL_PRODUCT_COMPLIANCE_SPEC.md` §3) is the Sprint 1+ replacement.

## ADR-012 — `prospect_type` and `speaker_mode` are captured but not yet policy-branching
Status: accepted (tech debt)

`PolicyContext` carries `prospect_type` (b2b/b2c/unknown) and `speaker_mode` for context
and audit-trail completeness, but `evaluate()` does not yet branch on them — the current
`jurisdictions.yaml` schema has no B2B/B2C-specific values to branch on. Extending the
yaml schema with such overrides (e.g. stricter consumer-call rules) is a Sprint 1+
candidate once real campaigns need it, rather than inventing untested tiers now.
